 PART I Item 1. BUSINESS The Hershey Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24, 1927 as a successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey. In this report, the terms “Hershey,” “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean The Hershey Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which it has a controlling financial interest, unless the context indicates otherwise. Hershey is a global confectionery leader known for bringing goodness to the world through chocolate, sweets, mints, gum and other great tasting snacks. We are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America, a leading snack maker in the United States and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. We market, sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 85 countries worldwide. Reportable Segments Our organizational structure is designed to ensure continued focus on North America, coupled with an emphasis on profitable growth in our focus international markets. Our business is primarily organized around geographic regions, which enables us to build processes for repeatable success in our global markets. As a result, we have defined our operating segments on a geographic basis, as this aligns with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) manages our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment. Our North America business, which generates approximately 89% of our consolidated revenue, is our only reportable segment. None of our other operating segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, these operating segments are combined and disclosed below as International and Other. • North America - This segment is responsible for our traditional chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position, as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions, in the United States and Canada. This includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, pantry, food service and other snacking product lines. • International and Other - International and Other is a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually material, including those geographic regions where we operate outside of North America. We currently have operations and manufacture product in China, Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia, primarily for consumers in these regions, and also distribute and sell confectionery products in export markets of Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Europe, Africa and other regions. This segment also includes our global retail operations, including Hershey's Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania, New York City, Las Vegas, Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain of the Company's trademarks and products to third parties around the world. Financial and other information regarding our reportable segments is provided in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Acquisitions In September 2019, we completed the acquisition of ONE Brands, LLC ("ONE Brands"), previously a privately held company that sells a line of low-sugar, high-protein nutrition bars to retailers and distributors in the United States, with the ONE Bar as its primary product. In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Pirate Brands, which includes the Pirate's Booty, Smart Puffs and Original Tings brands, from B&G Foods, Inc. Pirate Brands offers baked, trans fat free and gluten free snacks and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the United States. In January 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. ("Amplify"), a publicly traded company based in Austin, Texas that owns several popular better-for-you snack brands such as SkinnyPop, Oatmega and Paqui. The acquisition enables us to capture more consumer snacking occasions by creating a broader portfolio of brands. The Hershey Company | 2019 Form 10-K | Page 1 Products and Brands Our principal product offerings include chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products; gum and mint refreshment products; snack items such as popcorn, protein bars and cookies, spreads, bars and snack bites/mixes, and meat snacks; and pantry items, such as baking ingredients, toppings and beverages. • Within our North America markets, our product portfolio includes a wide variety of chocolate offerings marketed and sold under the renowned brands of Hershey’s, Reese’s and Kisses, along with other popular chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery brands such as Jolly Rancher, Almond Joy, Brookside, barkTHINS, Cadbury, Good & Plenty, Heath, Kit Kat® , Lancaster, Payday, Rolo® , Twizzlers, Whoppers and York. We also offer premium chocolate products, primarily in the United States, through the Scharffen Berger and Dagoba brands.

Principal Customers and Marketing Strategy Our customers are mainly wholesale distributors, chain grocery stores, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, dollar stores, concessionaires and department stores. The majority of our customers, with the exception of wholesale distributors, resell our products to end-consumers in retail outlets in North America and other locations worldwide. In 2019, approximately 30% of our consolidated net sales were made to McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities, product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products. We devote considerable resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products. We utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers, as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products, to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year. In conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts, our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers. We primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers. Raw Materials and Pricing Cocoa products, including cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans, are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products. These cocoa products are purchased directly from third-party suppliers, who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in Far Eastern, West African, Central and South American regions. West Africa accounts for approximately 70% of the world’s supply of cocoa beans. Adverse weather, crop disease, political unrest and other problems in cocoa-producing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past, but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop and/or exports. In the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country, we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer. The Hershey Company | 2019 Form 10-K | Page 2 Our trading company in Switzerland performs all aspects of cocoa procurement, including price risk management, physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight. The trading company was implemented to optimize the supply chain for our cocoa requirements, with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence. It also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups, the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources. We also use substantial quantities of sugar, Class II and IV dairy products, peanuts, almonds and energy in our production process. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. For our international operations, inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries. We change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs, the competitive environment and profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. Price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs, including raw and packaging materials, fuel, utilities, transportation costs and employee benefits. When we implement price increases, there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales, in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases. In addition, promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date, delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales. Competition Many of our confectionery brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in North America and certain markets in Latin America. We sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational, national, regional and local firms. Some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, as well as convenience and service. We have also experienced increased competition from other snack items, which we are focused on expanding the boundaries of our core confection brands to capture new snacking occasions. Working Capital, Seasonality and Backlog Our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year, representing seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt. Therefore, the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales. Additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Trademarks, Service Marks and License Agreements We own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. The trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the United States and other key international markets where our products are sold. We also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items, flavored milks and various other products primarily under the Hershey’s and Reese’s brand names. The Hershey Company | 2019 Form 10-K | Page 3 Furthermore, we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell and distribute certain products. Our rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at our option. Our most significant licensing agreements are as follows: Company Brand Location Requirements Kraft Foods Ireland Intellectual Property Limited/Cadbury UK Limited York Peter Paul Almond Joy Peter Paul Mounds Worldwide None Cadbury UK Limited Cadbury Caramello United States Minimum sales requirement exceeded in 2019 Société des Produits Nestlé SA Kit Kat® Rolo® United States Minimum unit volume sales exceeded in 2019 Iconic IP Interests, LLC Good & Plenty Heath Jolly Rancher Milk Duds Payday Whoppers Worldwide None Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities in a number of countries, including the United States, Mexico, Brazil, India and China. We develop new products, improve the quality of existing products, improve and modernize production processes, and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning our research and development expense is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Food Quality and Safety Regulation The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the United States. We believe our Product Excellence Program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program. This program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase, manufacture and distribute are safe, are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Through our Product Excellence Program, we evaluate our supply chain including ingredients, packaging, processes, products, distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary. We identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety. Various government agencies and third-party firms as well as our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations. Environmental Considerations Beyond ordinary course operating and capital expenditures we make to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have made a number of commitments to protect and reduce our impact on the environment in recent years, including efforts to protect forests and forested habitats and reduce emissions across our supply chain. The annual operating and capital expenditures associated with these ordinary course payments and additional commitments are not material with respect to our results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. The Hershey Company | 2019 Form 10-K | Page 4 Employees As of December 31, 2019, the Company employed approximately 14,520 full-time and 1,620 part-time employees worldwide.

During 2020, agreements will be negotiated for certain employees at three facilities outside of the United States and one United States facility, comprising approximately 74% of total employees under collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are generally good. Financial Information by Geographic Area Our principal operations and markets are located in the United States. The percentage of total consolidated net sales for our businesses outside of the United States was 15.8% for 2019, 16.1% for 2018 and 16.7% for 2017. The percentage of total long-lived assets outside of the United States was 20.2% as of December 31, 2019 and 21.7% as of December 31, 2018. Sustainability The Hershey Company’s commitment to sustainability started with our founder’s belief in responsible citizenship. He was a purpose-driven leader who believed we could use chocolate to create goodness in the world. This belief resulted in strong investment in local communities and the establishment of the Milton Hershey School for disadvantaged kids. We continue that legacy today through our sustainability strategy “The Shared Goodness Promise” by operating the business with sustainable practices, sourcing ingredients responsibly, protecting our environment, making a difference in our communities and helping kids globally reach their full potential.
