 PART I Item 1. Business. Introduction We are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Corona, Modelo Especial, Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Meiomi and SVEDKA Vodka. In the U.S., we are the number one sales growth driver at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. We are the third-largest beer company in the U.S. market and a leading, higher-end wine company in the U.S. market. Many of our products are recognized as leaders in their respective categories. This, combined with our strong market positions, makes us a supplier of choice to many of our customers, who include wholesale distributors, retailers and on-premise locations. Our vision is to elevate life with every glass raised and our mission is to build brands that people love. We are committed to brand building, our trade partners, the environment, our investors and to consumers around the world who choose our products when celebrating big moments or enjoying quiet ones. Our key values are: • people; • customer focus; • entrepreneurship; • quality; and • integrity. The Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945. We have approximately 9,800 employees located primarily in the U.S. and Mexico, with our corporate headquarters located in Victor, New York. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities. Strategy Our overall strategy is to drive industry-leading growth and shareholder value by building brands that people love when celebrating big moments or enjoying quiet ones. We position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led trend toward premiumization, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine and spirits categories. 1 To capitalize on premiumization trends, become more competitive and grow our business, we have generally employed a strategy focused on a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, with a focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry. Key elements of our strategy include: • leveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio and to provide for cross promotional opportunities; • strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights; • investing in brand building and innovation activities; • positioning ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics; • realizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and • developing employees to enhance performance in the marketplace. In the beer business, we have solidified our position in the U.S. beer market; enhanced our margins, results of operations and operating cash flow; and provided new avenues for growth. We have made capital investments and acquisitions to increase beer production capacity to secure independence from a supply standpoint and to support the growth of the business. Additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, we’ve made several acquisitions of high-quality, regional craft beer brands and leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends. In our wine and spirits business, as part of our efforts to focus on higher-end brands, improve margins and create operating efficiencies, we have acquired higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands and portfolios of brands, including Meiomi, Prisoner and Charles Smith, and have strategically optimized the value of this business, particularly lower-margin, lower-growth products, with the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the expected transaction, which was recently announced, to divest a portion of our wine and spirits business. In addition, we have added higher-end brands to our spirits portfolio through the acquisitions of Casa Noble tequila and High West craft whiskeys. Within our Corporate Operations and Other segment, we complemented our total beverage alcohol strategy in an adjacent category by making investments in Canopy, a world-leading, diversified cannabis company. These investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property and retailing. For further information on our strategy, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“MD&A”). Investments and Acquisitions In connection with our strategy outlined above, we completed the following investments and acquisitions during Fiscal 2019 : Transaction Date Strategic Contribution Corporate Operations and Other Segment Canopy Growth Corporation investments November 2018 and June 2018 Investment in Ontario, Canada-based public company; leading provider of medicinal and recreationally legal cannabis products; supported our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics. Beer Segment Four Corners acquisition July 2018 Portfolio of high-quality, dynamic and bicultural, Texas-based craft beers; strengthened our position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. 2 For further information about our Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 transactions, refer to (i) MD&A and (ii) Notes 2, 7 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Notes to the Financial Statements”). Business Segments We report our operating results in three segments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Corporate Operations and Other. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting. We report net sales in two reportable segments, as follows: Beer Segment We are the leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which includes the imported, craft, domestic super premium, and alternative beverage alcohol categories. We sell a number of brands in the high-end categories, driven largely by our imported Mexican beer portfolio. Within the imported beer category, we have the exclusive right to import, market and sell these Mexican beer brands in all 50 states of the U.S.: Corona Brand Family Modelo Brand Family Other Import Brands ● Corona Extra ● Corona Premier ● Corona Familiar ● Corona Light ● Modelo Especial ● Modelo Negra ● Modelo Chelada ● Pacifico ● Victoria In the U.S., we are the leading imported beer company and have eight of the 15 top-selling imported beer brands. Corona Extra is the best-selling imported beer and the sixth best-selling beer overall in the U.S. and Modelo Especial is the second-largest and the fastest-growing major imported beer brand. Since the June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have more than tripled our production capacity in Mexico from 10 million to approximately 34 million hectoliters. Our current production capacity provides us the opportunity to further expand our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market by increasing our investment behind on-trend innovation. As part of these efforts, we successfully introduced Corona Premier, a lower-calorie, lower-carbohydrate product offering, which has become one of the top growth contributors in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. For Fiscal 2020, we are launching Corona Refresca nationally to capitalize on the growth of the high-end alternative beverage alcohol category. Additionally, we are continuing efforts focused on increasing sales distribution of products in can, draft, single-serve and larger package size formats. Expansion and construction efforts continue under our Mexico Beer Expansion Projects. Since the June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have invested approximately $3.5 billion for the Mexico Beer Expansion Projects, with approximately $600 million during Fiscal 2019. To align with our anticipated future 3 growth expectations, we are targeting an additional 10 million hectoliters of production capacity expansion activities to be completed over the next four fiscal years. Our craft and specialty beer products are primarily sold under the Ballast Point brand. Ballast Point is led by its popular Sculpin IPA. In addition, the Funky Buddha and Four Corners acquisitions allow us to leverage our craft beer platform, capitalizing on the growth of high-quality, regional craft beer brands. Overall, our craft and specialty beer capabilities further strengthen our position as the leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. Wine and Spirits Segment We are a leading, higher-end wine and spirits company in the U.S. market, with a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. Our wine portfolio is supported by grapes purchased from independent growers, primarily in the U.S., New Zealand and Chile, and vineyard holdings in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy. Our wine produced in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy is primarily marketed in the U.S. In addition, we export our wine products to Canada and other major world markets. Our spirits offerings include SVEDKA Vodka, which is imported from Sweden and is the largest imported vodka brand in the U.S. Our higher-end spirits brands include Casa Noble tequila and High West craft whiskeys. In the U.S., we have 18 of the 100 top-selling wine brands. Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands, and portfolio of brands, sold in the U.S., which comprised our Fiscal 2019 U.S. Focus Brands (“Focus Brands”), included: Wine Brands Wine Portfolio of Brands Spirits Brands ● 7 Moons ● Mark West ● Robert Mondavi ● Charles Smith ● Casa Noble ● Black Box ● Meiomi ● Ruffino ● Prisoner ● High West ● Clos du Bois ● Mount Veeder ● Schrader ● SVEDKA Vodka ● Franciscan Estate ● Nobilo ● Simi ● Kim Crawford ● Ravage ● The Dreaming Tree We dedicate a large share of sales and marketing resources to our Focus Brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally hold strong positions in their respective price categories. We have been increasing resources in support of on-trend product innovation as we believe this is one of the key drivers of overall beverage alcohol category growth. In wine, we have launched varietal line extensions behind many of our Focus Brands, such as Bourbon Barrel Aged Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Meiomi Rosé, and we have introduced newer brands like Derange, Spoken Barrel, Cooper & Thief and Crafters Union. In spirits, we have introduced Mi CAMPO tequila. In connection with our efforts to increase focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands, in April 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices and facilities, for approximately $1.7 billion, subject to certain closing adjustments. The Wine and Spirits Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals (see “Recent Developments” in MD&A and Note 23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). Corporate Operations and Other The Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related items including costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and information technology, as well as our investments in Canopy and those made through our corporate venture capital function. 4 Further information regarding net sales, operating income and total assets of each of our business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in Note 22 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Marketing and Distribution To focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity and increase sales, our segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service functions. These functions engage in a range of marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions and public relations. Where opportunities exist, particularly with national accounts in the U.S., we leverage our sales and marketing skills across the organization. In the U.S., our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i) our beer portfolio and (ii) our wine and spirits portfolio, as well as state alcohol beverage control agencies. As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency’s state. State governments can affect prices paid by consumers of our products through the imposition of taxes or, in states in which the government acts as the distributor of our products through an alcohol beverage control agency, by directly setting the retail prices. Trademarks and Distribution Agreements Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. Throughout our segments, we also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products and products of third parties. These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations. Within the Beer segment, we have an exclusive sub-license to use trademarks related to our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. This sub-license agreement is perpetual. Prior to our June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, Crown Imports had exclusive importation agreements with the suppliers of certain imported beer products and had an exclusive renewable sub-license to use certain trademarks related to the imported beer brands in the U.S. Competition The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors include: Beer Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors, Heineken, Pabst Brewing Company, The Boston Beer Company, Mark Anthony Wine E. & J. Gallo Winery, The Wine Group, Trinchero Family Estates, Treasury Wine Estates, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits, Jackson Family Wines Spirits Diageo, Beam Suntory, Brown-Forman, Sazerac Company, Pernod Ricard Production Our current production capacity in Mexico at our Nava and Obregon breweries is approximately 34 million hectoliters. Prior to the acquisition of the Obregon Brewery, we entered into a three-year interim supply agreement with Modelo in June 2013, which was initially extended for one additional year through June 2017. However, the purchase of the Obregon Brewery enabled us to become fully independent from this interim supply agreement, which was terminated at the time of this acquisition. In addition, we are expanding the Obregon Brewery and constructing the Mexicali Brewery, located near California, which is our largest imported beer market in the U.S. 5 Based on our anticipated future growth expectations, we intend to expand our production capacity in Mexico to approximately 44 million hectoliters over the next four fiscal years. Our craft beer production requirements are primarily fulfilled by our Miramar and Daleville facilities, located in the greater San Diego, California, and Roanoke, Virginia, areas, respectively. These facilities can be expanded to accommodate future growth. We also operate multiple tap rooms with smaller scale production and innovation capabilities. In the U.S., we operate 18 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin regions of California. We also operate three wineries in New Zealand and six wineries in Italy. Grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk. The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year’s grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent year’s crush. Wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in September through November in the U.S. and Italy, and in March through May in New Zealand. Our Canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our Canadian distillery in Lethbridge, Alberta. We currently operate two facilities in the U.S. for the production of our High West whiskey brand. The requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various suppliers. Certain of our wines and spirits must be aged for more than one year up to multiple years. Therefore, our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses. Sources and Availability of Production Materials The principal components in the production of our Mexican and craft beer brands include water; agricultural products, such as yeast and grains; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum and cardboard. For our Mexican beer brands, packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials. For Fiscal 2019, the package format mix of our Mexican beer volume sold in the U.S. was 69% glass bottles, 28% aluminum cans and 3% in stainless steel kegs. The Nava and Obregon breweries receive water originating from aquifers. We believe we have adequate access to water to support the breweries’ on-going requirements, as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion activities. As part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the long-term, we formed an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world’s largest glass container manufacturer. The joint venture acquired a state-of-the-art glass production plant that is located adjacent to our Nava Brewery in Mexico, in December 2014. The glass plant currently has four operational glass furnaces and the joint venture intends to increase it to five furnaces by the end of calendar 2019. When fully operational with five furnaces, the glass plant is expected to supply approximately 60% of our glass requirements for the Nava Brewery. We also have long-term glass supply agreements with other glass producers. The principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials (primarily glass). Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October in the U.S. and Italy, and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand. We receive grapes from approximately 800 independent growers in the U.S. and approximately 165 independent growers located primarily in New Zealand and Chile. We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is largely based on then-current market prices. 6 As of February 28, 2019, we owned or leased approximately 20,500 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy. This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production. However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higher-end wines. We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply. We believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations. However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world. The distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market. We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time. We utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products. After grape purchases, glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold. In the U.S., the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers. We have traditionally obtained, and continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements. Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations. We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time. Government Regulation We are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities. Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising and public relations. We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership or control. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Seasonality The beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category. As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S. Our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying. Employees As of February 28, 2019, we had approximately 9,800 employees. Approximately 4,900 employees were in the U.S. and approximately 4,900 employees were outside of the U.S., primarily in Mexico. We may employ additional workers during the grape crushing seasons. Approximately 21% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements expiring within one year are minimal. We consider our employee relations generally to be good. 7 Executive Officers of the Company Information with respect to our current executive officers is as follows: NAME AGE OFFICE OR POSITION HELD Robert Sands 60 Executive Chairman of the Board Richard Sands 68 Executive Vice Chairman of the Board William A.
